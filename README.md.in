# moire (mwah-ray)

Runtime graph instrumentation for Tokio-based Rust systems.

Moiré replaces Tokio's primitives with named, instrumented wrappers. At every API boundary — every lock acquisition, channel send/receive, spawn, and RPC call — it captures the current call stack via frame-pointer walking. The resulting graph of entities (tasks, locks, channels, RPC calls) connected by typed edges (polls, waiting_on, paired_with, holds) is pushed as a live stream to `moire-web` for investigation.

The dashboard shows you which tasks are stuck, what they are waiting on, and exactly where in your code they got there.
