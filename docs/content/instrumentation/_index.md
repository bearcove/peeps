peeps wraps runtime primitives so causality is visible in the graph. With `diagnostics` disabled, wrappers become pass-throughs.

These pages focus on intent:

- what each category represents in the graph,
- which causal edges to expect,
- how to interpret behavior when debugging.

Exact fields and wrappers are implementation details and may change with releases.
